A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/Wking/pen/BdmpVx.

 First in series of pens where I just want to make a library of useful tricks I have used for websites. In this one the key trick is multiline underline with any color I want. This is show using a random gradient so I could practice some more javascript.
